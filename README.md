# Mini-Project_Bosco Grip cart

The advent of wireless technology along with the other communication
techniques help in making e-commerce very popular. Modern futuristic
product is the one that aids the comfort, convenience and efficiency in
everyday life. In this project, we discuss an innovative concept of RFID Based
Smart Shopping and Billing System. The main goal is to provide a technology
oriented, low-cost, easily scalable, and rugged system for aiding shopping in
person. The smart shopping trolley will help shorten the checkout lines
thereby helping the customers at retail stores. The System consists of an RFID
based trolley which communicates with the billing counter wirelessly. The
customers will be able to scan the items themselves and the LCD screen on the
shopping cart will keep updating the total. The billing counter can at any point
of time inquire about the current items present in the trolley. This will turn out
to be very beneficial for the retail stores as more people will enjoy the
shopping experience and come more often to shop.

 INTRODUCTION

Nowadays, most people go shopping daily for food, electronics, other necessary
items. The number of people who visit the mall/ shopping marts is increased every
day because of the increase in population.
The customer faces many problems while shopping like wasting a lot of time in the
queue at the cashier, the smart trolley system is a device which helps customer to
calculate the total amount of all item inside the trolley when shopping in the mall.
This smart device will be put on the top of the trolley. It will provide full details of
each item like detecting the item name, price and will display the total price. It
reduces manpower required in billing section and reduces time spent at billing
counter, it increases customer satisfaction, customers can see the full details of
product, users can be aware of the total bill amount before going to the cashier for
the payment.

METHODOLOGY

Our project includes STM nuecleo board as our microcontroller
along with an I2C based LCD display and an RFID reader, RC522 module and
few RFID tags. we bring our RFID tag in asile our reader as an output we get an
unique ID of that tag ,We have a separate tag for every unit product it means
every RFID tag when brought close to the reader we get details about that
product and these details of the product are reflected in the LCD display which
is also interfaced with our nuecleo board.


OBJECTIVE

Everyone can rely on this in the
future as this will help them to
keep a check on the total
amount while shopping and will
also
reduce massive lines in
shopping malls/ shopping marts
during
the billing process.

CONCLUSION

As the user keeps on adding different items, the number of items keeps
on increasing and the total price also keeps on adding and increasing.
Finally, when the admin RFID tag
is brought forward, it stops the loop and the final price of all the
products in the cart is displayed.The completed project has fulfilled
most of the stated objectives.
Effective time management and proper coding has played a large part
in making the project a success.
