# Mini-Project_Bosco Grip cart

The advent of wireless technology along with the other communication
techniques help in making e-commerce very popular. Modern futuristic
product is the one that aids the comfort, convenience and efficiency in
everyday life. In this project, we discuss an innovative concept of RFID Based
Smart Shopping and Billing System. The main goal is to provide a technology
oriented, low-cost, easily scalable, and rugged system for aiding shopping in
person. The smart shopping trolley will help shorten the checkout lines
thereby helping the customers at retail stores. The System consists of an RFID
based trolley which communicates with the billing counter wirelessly. The
customers will be able to scan the items themselves and the LCD screen on the
shopping cart will keep updating the total. The billing counter can at any point
of time inquire about the current items present in the trolley. This will turn out
to be very beneficial for the retail stores as more people will enjoy the
shopping experience and come more often to shop.
